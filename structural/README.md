# This codebase is an example of an adapter design pattern

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two objects by translating the interface of one class into another that a client expects. Essentially, the adapter allows classes that couldn't otherwise interact because of incompatible interfaces to do so.
